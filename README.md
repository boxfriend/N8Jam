# Hackerman README
###### Project made for [N8Jam](https://itch.io/jam/n8jam) Game Jam
---
Theme of the jam is "Break the System" with an optional piece of lore: "I could almost feel its potential as they dropped it into my hand. A loud thump echoing through the area reminded me, this was not the end.”

The theme of the jam led me to the hacker theme for the game. The original idea for the game was to create a game similar to the classic Megaman games. This of course led to the Hackerman name and inspired the character sprites which are based on Megaman sprites.
